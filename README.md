# APPLESOFT BASIC
Games (and other things I suppose) coded in Applesoft BASIC. You can find an Applesoft BASIC emulator at: https://calormen.com/jsbasic/

Applesoft BASIC was first released in 1978 by Microsoft for the Apple II computer. So, it's pretty old - so why am I still using it? Ah. Good question. I started using Applesoft BASIC because it was simple to learn and easy to code; not because it's particually powerful or useful (because it isn't). However, it is a simple coding language that one can use to make simple text programs, so it's my go-to for things like that - simple text games, small calculations, etc. It also provides a limited amount of visual graphics, with lines, but I never really learned to do that (well, except for my random terrain generator). Really, the only problem for Applesoft BASIC is finding an interpreter for it - but, if you look above, that's a problem I've solved.

So please enjoy my Applesoft BASIC things.
